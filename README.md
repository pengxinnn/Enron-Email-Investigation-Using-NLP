# Enron-Email-Investigation-Using-NLP

Enron was an American energy company and was one of the largest electricity and natural gas companies in the world. However, at the end of 2001, its financial condition was revealed to be an accounting fraud. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has generated many Enron emails during the investigation.

We are using 1980 Enron emails of Enron's top executives to provide an overview of Enron Scandal and recommendations for who to investigate at what times on what general topics by using Natural Language Processing.

Models and approaches proposed and implemented:
1. Topic modeling using LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
2. Simple keyword search.
3. Topic modeling on emails with negative sentiment scores.
4. Run a topic model on the whole corpus using LDA, then see how topic use varies with time.
5. Top2Vec (Angelov, D., 2020.) for topic modeling.
6. Dynamic topic model.
7. Network analysis.
